erl_img: Erlang image processing library
========================================

erl_img is a library for reading and writing image files. The goal is to
provide the Erlang community with functionality similar to ImageMagick. erl_img
was originally excavated from the Jungerl repository, but a number of
modifications have since been made.

API
---

To use erl_img, you will need to include the erl_image.hrl header file to get
the appropriate record definitions. The erl_img API is:

    % Read
    erl_img:load("/path/to/image.ext") -> {ok, IMG#erl_image}

    % Get the MIME type
    erl_img:mime_type(IMG) -> "image/something"

    % Resize
    IMG1 = erl_image:resize(IMG, 0.5) % scale factor

    % Crop
    IMG2 = erl_image:crop(IMG1, 
            IMG1#erl_image.width / 2,  % new width
            IMG1#erl_image.height / 2, % new height
            IMG1#erl_image.width / 4,  % x offset
            IMG1#erl_image.height / 4) % y offset

    % convert to PNG
    IMG3 = IMG2#erl_image{ type = image_png, filename = "/path/to/image.png" }

    % Write
    erl_img:save(IMG3) -> ok


Formats
-------

As of this writing, the number of image formats is fairly limited. The following
table summarizes file format support present in erl_img:

    Format      Read/Write/Metadata?
    
    BMP         Read only
    GIF         Read only
    JPEG        Metadata only
    PNG         Read/Write/Metadata
    TGA         Read/Write
    TIFF        Read/Metadata
    XPM         Read only

Even if your desired format can be written, note that you may have to perform
addtional processing to convert one format to another. Pixel information is
stored in a number of formats internally, and some file types only support some
formats. For example, if you read a file in BGR format, but the destination
file type only supports RGB, it is your responsibility to perform the
pixel-by-pixel channel reversal.

The following table summarizes the pixel formats that can be read and written
by each file type.
